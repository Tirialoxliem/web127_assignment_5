        What keeps your eyes from wanting to move on to the next classic car
        sitting at the show, or the next website of a topic or item that you are
        researching? Well, it is the perfect design, of course. With classic
        cars it starts with the paint because that is the first thing that you
        see, so, you want to stand out. A great paint design is a perfect start
        for your classic car. Next, maybe you want to focus on the design of
        your interior, do you want a basic interior, or do you want the great
        design with the perfect swarm of colors? Just like a classic car, you
        want your website to have a perfect design. Perfect design includes your
        color scheme, the layout, and all the different CSS styles that you use
        throughout your website.
