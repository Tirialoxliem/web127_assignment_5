      <p id="p1">
        A very important part of having a beautiful classic car, or beautiful
        website is to keep it nice, and clean. I mean, who wants to see a dirty
        beat up classic car, or a horrible website with no upkeep? Can you
        imagine going to a car show, and seeing a potentially beautiful classic
        car sitting there, that is dirty with "clean me" written on the back of
        it with someone's finger swipes in the dirt? That would be down right
        awful. The same rules apply to your website. You want your website to be
        nice and clean, and not a big, jumbled mess.
